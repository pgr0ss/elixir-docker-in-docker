# Elixir and Docker in Docker

This Dockerfile combines Elixir and docker-in-docker.

This Dockerfile is based on [trenpixster/elixir-dockerfile](https://github.com/trenpixster/elixir-dockerfile) for Elixir and adds the docker-in-docker pieces from [jpetazzo/dind](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind).
